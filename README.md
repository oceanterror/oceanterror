i enjoy these two. my qp thangs

but hai hellooo i am boombox / ephe ^_^ i go by it / its mainly, but i don't mind any pronouns and terms. i'm making this because i'm too lazy to edit my rentry Oops. umm i'm that one sebastian solace guy he's my creature i grill him every day :heart: i hate him. sebphe canon though. i am also currently very hyperfixated on just overwatch my apologies. IT'S NOT MY FAULT I SWEAR. but umm ask me about it (especially genyatta) i like it and the characters even though i am ass at the game :] bastion is my child i love them so much i need to get that out there. i do also like many roblox games though! just roblox sorry. more important things i'm 20 years old Sorry maybe that's the reason i like overwatch Umm i'm also very mentally ill. bpdtistic guy with horrible anxiety and more unlisted, it'll obviously affect how i interact with people but it won't be that much especially if we talk like once :sob: i am a very chill fellow i promise

okay ponytown stuff Yay! i am offtab / not paying attention a LOT and i'm mainly with my friends whenever i do get on. despite my horrible anxiety, i don't mind if people cuddle and hide behind me ^_^ or any interactions in general (just know i never initiate interactions unless you're my friend). i prefer things to be whispered to me so i can see it eventually. don't copy my skins, inspo is fine though! uhhhh i don't really mind anything really, i'll talk to anyone unless they're a weirdo then i'll just hide them

shoutout to genyatta for existing
